Project Development requirements: Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process
Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**
Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.

Project Requirements: You will also be responsible for preparing a 10 minute presentation, where you explain in detail:
The questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them
Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
Your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary as well as visualizations of that summary
Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".
