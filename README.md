# Project1: Analysis of Opportunities and Trends in the Data Job Market

As aspiring data scientists, we wanted to use what we have learned to far to explore our future options in the data science job market. Our analysis was more of an exploratory look at data job postings. We had many hunches about what we might see, and the point of our project was to confirm or deny these and assess the truth/strength of these trends so that we can be better informed job hunters

For a look at our early though process and approach to this project, please refer to the "initial planning" document here:

Hypotheses:

        1. The majority of data science jobs on in the US market listed
            on Indeed will be located in California.
        2. We we expect to see a strong correlation between expected
            income and job satisfaction
        3. We expect that those in smaller companies will tend to be happier 
            than those in larger comnpanies (judging by company ratings)
        4. The majority of postings will be categorised (by industry) as 
            "Internet and Software".
        5. The most valued skill (by number of mentions in postings) will 
            be python and SQL

Major Findings
  
  Nothing we found was incredibly shocking, but our data analysis did provide a fair bit of nuance to our initial assumptions.
  
    1. California did in fact dominate the job market, accounting for 24.44% of listed positions, however, the majority
        of positions in the US market were actually in Consulting (see conclusion #4), and the vast majority of listed 
        consulting positions were not in states other than California. The California Market was dominated by  
        internet/software.
    2. Though we did see a strong correlation between job satisfaction and expected income, there were interesting
        differences between data job categories. For instance, those making under 80k were much happier than we expected
        (espescially the data scientists) . After looking through the data, it seems like we might account for this happiness 
        because many of these postings were for mission driven work (which tends to be poorly paid)
    3. Our dataset only described company size as over 10,000 employees and under 10,000 eployees, so it is hard to get a 
        reading on how size impacts happiness.  We did not see a correlation between these two factors (p value was 0.24).  I 
        believe that if we had better segmented company size data, we might be able to see comclusive trends.
    4. The majority of US postings were not in Internet/software, but in consulting.  software was dominant in California
        though.
    5.The most valued skills were Python and SQL, though there were very real and marked differences in skill listings for
        data scientists vs data anylists vs data engineers.
